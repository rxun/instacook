# Flask + React Starter

Simple starter for Flask and React base apps.

## How does it work

`npm` is used to build both the backend (Python/Flask) and frontend (React/Javascript) code, specifically:

#### Python

* Python dependencies are managed in `.requirements.txt`
* `.start.sh` (copied from [https://glitch.com/~python3](https://glitch.com/~python3)) runs Pip against the `.requirements.txt` if needed before starting Flask app

#### Javascript

* Javascript dependencies are managed in `package.json`

Add them to `.requirements.txt`

### Adding Javascript dependencies

Add them to `package.json`
